# TMDb-Movies
The dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database(TMDb), including 21 features like popularity,revenue,genres. 
The questions I plan to explore over the dataset are basically from the example questions given by the project introcution: which genres are most popular from those years? what kinds of properties are asscociated with movies that have high revenues?
