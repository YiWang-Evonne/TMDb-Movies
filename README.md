# TMDb-Movies
The Data set I selected for Investigating is TMDb movie data, this dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database(TMDb), including 21 features like popularity , revenue, genres. The questions I plan to explore over the dataset are basically from the example questions given by the project introcution: which genres are most popular from those years? what kinds of properties are asscociated with movies that have high revenues? If I have more time I would like to do more analysis about the correlation btw directors and high revenue movies ;)
